# The ChefWaiter Revolution

Imagine a high-end restaurant serving **very** exotic foods (difficult to
comprehend, let alone eat and transport) for adventurous eaters. There are two
sides to the operation, the chefs and the waiting staff.

In my analogy:

- The chefs team represent developers
- The very exotic food represents the program
- The waiting team represents operations
- The customers represent the various servers / devices where running the program

The chefs are responsible for creating amazing, **out there** experiences for
the customers. The waiting team is responsible for bringing the "experiences" to
the customers and helping them figure out how on earth to consume the ridiculous
creations.

Being traditional, the chefs hold meetings together, create detailed plans for
how the food should look and how it was going to **WOW** their customers. They
then dump their creations at the outlet to the restaurant and consider their job
well done. The waiters do their best but are often as confused as the customers.
They have to make up their own instructions and often stand next to them as they
eat, ready to try to give feedback at a moment's notice on how they with their
experience believe the food is supposed to be eaten.

Customer satisfaction is dropping. Sometimes the customers just quit and walk
out, and it is difficult to determine why. Tensions are rising... The chefs
blame the waiters for being lazy and not showing the customers how to eat. The
waiters blame the chefs for giving no thought to the how the real world works
and how it would actually be to consume the food they made.

Along comes the ChefWaiter movement. It brings the waiting staff into the
kitchen and the chefs out into the restaurant, with the goal of effectivizing
/ minimizing the need for traditional waiting. The staff are re-branded and the
figurative walls between the kitchen and the restaurant are torn down. The new
chef-waiters work together to plan and execute not just the preparation in the
kitchen but also the delivery to the customers.

Improvements included things like: 

- Better food wrapping, so that (still very exotic) food can be brought in a consistent way.
- Detailed instructions are attached with each food, so the customers know how to eat the food that would be included in the package.
- The chef-waiters work together from the early meal-planning stage to produce food that is easier for customers to consume.
- A survey flow is introduced, with specially tailored questions for customers at dedicated times, to figure out how they experience new foods, so that quick adaptations can be made.

In the ChefWaiter community there are still a continuum of staff members with
skills leaning more toward cooking or waiting. As the restaurant grows
chef-waiter starts becoming its own thing (instead of just being a movement).
Chef-waiter increasingly becomes the term for an individual tasked with
effectivizing the journey from the kitchen to the customers, such that the need
for traditional waiting is minimized.
